Yup.   

After hours of frustration trying to figure out what possibly went wrong, it turns
out that iOS5 does not support [bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind).
This crucial part of the EcmaScript standard. What a shame. I totally thought
I could use this feature in all modern browsers.
