So I had my blog running on Octopress for a little while (although I didn't actually do much writing then).
It was kind of nice but I still wanted something a bit simpler and more light-weight.   

I really like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a blogging platform and recently I've been using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for some projects,
which is also very nice. So I decided to combine them both together. After adding some nice stuff to get up
and running quickly I realized that others might like a light-weight no-fuss way to get up and running with Jekyll too.
So I moved all the general stuff into a repo and now I have another open source project:
[Jekyll-Jumpstart](https://github.com/sym3tri/jekyll-jumpstart).   

No dependencies are required.
If you know git and can use a text editor you can get a pretty nice looking Jekyll blog up and
running in about 5 minutes. After that you can configure everything to your heart's content.   

I'd love to hear any feedback if you end up using it.
