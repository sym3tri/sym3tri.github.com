<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<p>January 7, 2009</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As part of the eBusiness Team at NCC, Ed&#8217;s deep understanding of application development, quick ability to learn and wide ranges of experiences were all traits that made him a significant leader in building the eBusiness system which has given NCC a competitive edge in the advertising marketplace.
His ability to understand underlying business needs and processes and translate them into sophisticated, but easy-to-use web-based applications dramatically increased the efficiency of our nation-wide workforce and significantly improved our customers&#8217; purchase and management of our services. His project management skills and interactions with various internal and external teams allowed him to deliver superior systems in very short time frames.
Initially, Ed develop web-based tools using J2EE. He then successfully helped lead the effort to transition our architecture over to Microsoft&#8217;s .NET framework, increasing the impact of our eBusiness tools and significantly reducing the cost of development and maintenance of the systems.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rooth is one of the most creative colleagues I have had the pleasure of working with. His work ethic combined with his broad technical knowledge made him a great asset to the company.
We worked closely together for about 5 years. In that time, due in large part to Mr. Rooth, NCC was able to move from a company burdened by its own antiquated business processes, to a streamlined 21st century organization utilizing the latest technologies. Sales have more than doubled since he joined the company, now forecasted to reach over $1 billion in 2008.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Before I hired Ed, I built my first website not understanding most terminology in an HTML guidebook. Ed gave productive insight to updating the site and made impressive changes which surpass the quality of my competitors sites! He has also provided invaluable tutorials empowering me to do my own edits and understand the world of programming better. Since all work is in English and Japanese it has been very important that he is capable of working in both languages.
Ed completes all work by communicating with me via email overseas, without ever meeting or speaking on the phone. Quite often I find Ed has a better idea than I about the next step the site needs to take. It&#8217;s great to know there are still people that have such work ethic that you don&#8217;t even need to be in the same country to get the job done!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ed is truly a one-of-a-kind talent and an inspiration to those around him. Ed and I collaborated on many projects during our educational experience. However, no joint effort was more indicative of Ed&#8217;s capabilities than our &#8220;Senior Thesis&#8221;, when Ed took control of the project and lead us to the best showing of our entire class!
Since graduating Ed has continued to express his creative instincts by first taking a bite at the Big Apple and then heading overseas to Japan to further his cultural knowledge.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;a massive thanks and big up also goes to Ed Rooth for his [video] editing work. &#8230;Since joining the TTR family last year Ed&rsquo;s put in some amazing work with the video podcasts we&rsquo;ve been releasing this year, so a massive thanks goes out to him and he&rsquo;ll be sorely missed while he&rsquo;s gone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
